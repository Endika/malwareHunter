MalwareHunter
============
## What is MalwareHunter

In three words, MalwareHunter is a malware analysis application.
What does that mean? It simply means that you can throw any suspicious file at it and it will provide you back some static information as well as a detailed results outlining what such file did when executed inside an isolated environment..

## Install Requirements

- Install VirtualBox
- Create a windows machine named 'winxp' (it's not configurable)
- Install Volatility
- Install Snort 
- Install Inetsim
- Install tshark

## Install and Run 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abdesslem/malwareHunter.git
$ cd malwareHunter  
```
Run the tools in command line or web application
```
$ python main.py or python mainGui.py
```

## Purpose

The purpose of the malwareHunter is to determine:
* Static information (packers, strings, URL,...)
* The nature and purpose of the malware
* Interaction with file system
* Interaction with the registry
* Interaction with the network

And these functionalities are achieved as follow:

* Takes sample as input
* Perform statis analysis
* Reverts VM to clean snapshot
* Starts the VM
* Transfers the malware to VM
* Runs the monitorings tools
* Executes the malware for the specified time
* Stops the monitorings tools
* Suspends The VM
* Acquires the memory image
* Performs memory analysis using Volatility framework
* Stores the results (Final reports, pcaps and malicious artifacts for later analysis) 

## Components
 
### Modules
To get some information about the file, such as URL, strings, packers, anti-debug ... we used the peframe modules. This directory contain the code responsible for the static analysis.
### Web
The project's web interface is build with Bottle.
Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It isdistributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
### Sandbox
To be able to collect valuable data, it's important to run the sample in an isolated environement and automate the process of dynamic analysis.
